Users means users of your website or mobile app, who uses your website, do some activity on your
website like visit a page or a screen, take some action like clicks some button, buy a product or service etc.
Your application could have known or unknown users.
Known users could be those users who may be logged in or registered on your application or website
while unknown users could be those who have just visited on your website and you do not know who they are.
Unknown users could be converted to known users later after they provide some information 
or by logging or registering.

Once a user is traced or known, she could be an existing or a new user.
If you are integrated with UserNDot, we keep track of all your known and unknown users and all the activity they do.
Along with the events, UserNDot also captures the location, device etc.
Once a user is known, all the information which was tracked while the user was
unknown also gets automatically marked to the corresponding known user.

## User Attributes

User Attributes means the attributes which could be tracked as user properties by UserNDot.
There attributes could be later used to uniquely identify a user and could be used in segmenting users.
User attributes could be majorly divided into two types:
