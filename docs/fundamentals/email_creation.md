## Overview

UserNdot helps you manage your Email campaign effortlessly. You can either write your own Email or use our pre-built email [templates](/d/docs/fundamentals/templates) to reach your users. UserNdot doesn’t directly send Emails. The Emails are delivered through a third-party service provider (MailChimp, SendInBlue, and Amazon) which could be easily integrated by following some simple steps. You can send this Email to all your users or to a particular [segment of users](/d/docs/fundamentals/segments).

### First things First –
We assume that you have already integrated an Email service provider. [Click here](/d/docs/fundamentals/integrationOfEmail) to know more.
