## Overview

Push notification is a short message, an image, or a link which appears on the notification tray of the users who have installed your application on their mobile devices.

***With UserNDot you could easily set up push campaigns***. Our best in class campaign management system will automate your push campaign in a way which will allow you to send custom or personalized push notifications to segmented users on a particular date-time or when they act in a particular way. Once a campaign is created and has been sent, UserNDot analytic tool will help you with all the details like how many push notifications were sent, the conversion rate, click percentage etc. Just following a few steps will let you integrate [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) which will, in turn, send push notifications to the user.
 

### First things First –
We assume that you have already integrated [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/). To know more about how to integrate FCM to your campaign [Click here](/d/docs/integration/PushNotification-Integration).

#### Let’s look at the steps that need to be followed for creating a Push campaign – 

#### Step 1 – Creating a new Push campaign
For creating a new Push campaign you need to first click on **Create New Campaign** button and choose either iOS or AndroidPush from the drop-down menu.

#### Step 2 – You need to tell us few thing before we set everything up for you –
    
1.   Give your Campaign a name. Tell us who you want to send it to; it may be for all your users or for a particular segment.

2.  Tell us whether you want to send Push Notification once – It’s a onetime engagement where you will be sending the Notifications once to your user, best suited if you want to make any announcement or re-engage them again with your application.

* Or on multiple dates – Hence, engaging your users multiple times best suited when you want to promote a sale.

* Or Recurring – UserNDot can automate your campaign by sending them at regular interval (daily, monthly, and weekly). Best suited to retain your customer and brand building.
