## Overview

Segmentation is the process of dividing a market of potential customers into groups, or segments, based on past behaviour, actions taken in the past or actions they will take in real time. 

Segmenting the user with the help of past data may help you in many ways but Live Segmentation of users will help you know what's happening in your product in real time.

Once you define a set of behaviour or triggers through your UserNDot dashboard, UserNDot will monitor these triggers while they are happening. As soon as the defined set of triggers are hit UserNDot will then and there put the user responsible for the trigger into the segment you want them to be.

An example to live segmenting could be a trigger which gets fired when a user has added an item to his cart but did not buy it within 30 mins.

Let's look at the steps you need to follow to create a real-time segment.

## Steps

### Step 2 - There are two kinds of a real-time segment that you can create - 

**Single Action** - Creates a real-time segment based on an action (event performed).

**Single Action With No Action** - Create a real-time segment based on an action (event performed) and does not perform a subsequent action (event) within a specified duration.

Based on your need you can select any of the above.

### Step 3 - Selecting the trigger event.
