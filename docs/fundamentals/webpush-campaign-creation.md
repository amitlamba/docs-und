## Overview

Web Push notifications are alert-style messages which slide in at the top or bottom right corner of a desktop screen with short but important information. Just like push notifications you could send them even when the users are not on your website.

UserNDot’s best in class campaign management and tactical [segmentation](/d/docs/fundamentals/segments) procedures help you to send web push notification seamlessly. UserNDot automates the procedure and sends the notification the way you want them to be sent (custom as well as personalized templates), the time you want them to be sent (time-sensitive), and to whom you want them to be sent ([segmentation](/d/docs/fundamentals/segments)). You just need to define everything in advance while creating the campaign and leave rest on us. UserNDot supports web push notification for both desktop and mobile.

### First things First –
We assume that you have already configured and integrated web push notification to your console. [Click here](/d/docs/fundamentals/integrationOfwebpushnotification) to know more.

#### Let’s look at the steps that need to be followed for creating a WebPush campaign – 

#### Step 1 – Creating a new WebPush campaign

#### Step 2 – You need to tell us few thing before we set everything up for you –
    
1.   Give your Campaign a name. Tell us who you want to send it to; it may be for all your users or for a particular segment.

2.  Tell us whether you want to send WebPush Notification once – It’s a onetime engagement where you will be sending the Notifications once to your user, best suited if you want to make any announcement or re-engage them again with your website or application.

* Or on multiple dates – Hence, engaging your users multiple times best suited when you want to promote a sale.

* Or Recurring – UserNDot can automate your campaign by sending them at regular interval (daily, monthly, and weekly). Best suited to retain your customer and brand building.

* You can also schedule your campaign in future – UserNdot can automate your campaign so that you can send the notifications in future. Just put in the date and time and leave everything on us.
