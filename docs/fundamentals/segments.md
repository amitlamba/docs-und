## Overview

Segments is a group of users filtered based on past behaviour, actions, attributes etc or based on future actions in real time.
A segment is a very powerful way to visualize and keep track of users with particular behaviour e.g. 

### Examples
* Abandoned Cart users segment
* Frequent buyers users segment 
* High spending users segment.
* users who were once frequent visitors but have stopped coming for a while.
* Users who did a purchase of certain item let's say tv in last few days let's say 10 days
* Users who visited site last month but didn't visit in last 7 days
* Users who added to cart but didn't buy in next 10 minutes

> **Important :** You can keep a watch on them and see how the count of segment users is behaving over time.
 Moreover, you can also reach out to a particular segment with campaigns created directly from segment reachability




#### What can you do with segments?

### Analytics 
Keep an eye on the trend of users in a segment by week or days and see whether they are increasing, decreasing or constant.
 An increase in the number of users in frequent buyers segment is a good sign and you can focus more on them to keep them happy and engaged.

* watch a segment that has abandoned cart and see if they are decreasing and if not reach out to them with a campaign.

* See how many users lie in a segment at that point of time
* See reachability statistics like how many people can be reached with email or SMS and other media with this segment.
* Create a campaign with the medium of communication you like e.g. email , SMS or push notifications etc.
* segments can also be used to filter other reports e.g funnel and event data analysis by segment and do analytics of that particular segment.
