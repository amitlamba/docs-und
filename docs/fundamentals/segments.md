## Overview
Segmentation is the process of dividing a market of potential customers into groups, or segments, based on past behaviour, actions taken in the past or actions they will take in real time.
The segments need to be created in a way which will compose of consumers who will respond similarly to marketing strategies and who share similar traits such as interests, needs, or demographics.

### Some common user Segmentation approaches –
Some common user Segmentation approaches –
* Geographic - Based on the Nation, States, Regions etc.
* Demographics - Based on age, gender, family size, income, occupation education etc.
* Psychographic - Based on the way of living, personality, attitudes, social status etc.
* Behavioural - Based on User status, purchase occasion, loyalty, purchase, spending etc.

To make the above simpler let’s see how an e-commerce website segments its users - 

* Abandoned Cart users segment.
* Frequent buyers users segment.
* High spending users segment.
* Users who were once frequent visitors but have stopped coming for a while.
* Users who did a purchase of certain item let's say T.V in last few days let's say 10 days.
* Users who visited site last month but didn't visit in last 7 days.
* Users who added to cart but didn't buy in next 10 minutes.

> **Important :** You can keep a watch on them and see how the count of segment users is behaving over time.
 Moreover, you can also reach out to a particular segment with campaigns created directly from segment reachability




### What can you do with segments?

  Segmentation of the user base makes it easier for you to personalize marketing campaigns.
  By arranging your target market into segmented groups, rather than targeting each potential customer individually, you can be more efficient with their time, money, and other resources than if they were targeting consumers on an individual level. Grouping similar consumers together allow you to target specific audiences in a cost effective manner.

  Segmentation is mainly used to prioritize once target audiences.

### The below step by step procedure will guide you through the process of segmenting your users:

Step 1 –
  Log in to your UserNDot dashboard by putting in your credentials. Navigate to Segment in menu, by clicking it you will reach a page that displays list of segments that have been created (or will be created).

Step 2 - Click on the button on top right corner which will open a segment create page.

On segment create page, you can choose

  1. Actions that user did e.g. choose action charged you can select date range both absolute, like between two dates from a date picker as well as relative date range like in last 100 days. You can further add filters on that action by choosing properties and custom attributes related to that event, example amount greater than 500, done the first time, or colour of the product etc. You can also specify the count or sum on any property e.g. users who did it 3 time or users whose total amount is greater than 700.

Step 3 - Choose one or any of the combinations of above and press create segment, give it a name. Congratulations your first segment is created.You can see the created segment in the list.

### After Math

  Once you have created Segments our Segment View Page will help you to –
  * See the total number of users in the particular segment
  * See all the associated campaigns of the present segment.
  * Help you predict the number of people you could reach through a specific campaign for example 30 out of 100 could be reached through email marketing.

  #### Analytics
  Now that you have developed some market segments you may be required to evaluate them to ensure that they are useable and logical. To do this, you need to quickly assess the segments against a checklist of factors depending on your user base.

  For example if you are an e-commerce website

  * Watch a segment who have not logged in for 6 months. Reach out to them with special discounts through email or SMS campaign.
  * Watch a segment with high spending potential. Reach out to them with goods that can be bought by them with a campaign. 
  * Watch a segment that puts goods in their wish list. Constantly reach to them with some discounts on those products.

  The above are just a few examples where segmentation could be useful in reaching potential customers.


> **Important :** Keep an eye on the trend of users in a segment by week or days and see whether they are increasing, decreasing or constant. An increase in the number of users in frequent buyers segment is a good sign and you can focus more on them to keep them happy and engaged.
