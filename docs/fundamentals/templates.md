Templates can be created from the templates tab after logging in to your account.
Templates could be created for Emails, SMS, Android Push Notification, iOS Push Notification, or Web Push Notification.
Once you create a template, it could be used to create a campaign.
A Template could have the content you want to send, along with the placeholder variables which could be inserted from the system.
The placeholder varibales get replaced with the corresponding user's details at the time of campaign execution.
An email template could also have an unsubscribe link.

## Email Templates
Email Templates are the templates, created for email campaigns. Every email template should have a unique name.
While creating an email campaign you need to specify
the email subject, email body, email from, and message type. Email from could only be the verified email addresses, 
in the list created in settings. Email subject and email body can have placeholder variables.

## SMS Templates
Sms templates can be created from the Sms sub-tab in templates section. An Sms template should have a unique name.
 An sms does have a body but does not have a title.
Sms from could be specified in the sms provider and need not be provided here.
The sms body may contain placeholder variables.

## Web Push Notification Templates
Web push sub-tab in templates could be used to create a web push template, uniquely identified by name.
