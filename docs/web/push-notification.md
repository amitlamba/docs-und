Web Push notifications are alert-style messages which slide in at the top or bottom right corner of a desktop screen with short but important information. Just like push notifications, you could send them even when the users are not on your website. Currently, we support Fcm cloud messaging to send web notification to your user.

You could take help of our templates to create your notifications be it a banner or a box type push notification.

Web Push notification could be helpful to you in many ways - 

* You could add URL of the target page to the popup to increase the traffic of the page.

* You could add a banner to the popup which in turn will help you to make the user aware about a certain event, or even help you in brand building.

* Web Push is the best channel to run a re-engagement campaign as user doesn't needs to be on your website to receive them.

To send Web Push notification you need to configure the Google Firebase base cloud messaging (FCM) messaging to your campaign.

> **Important :** You can send Web Push Notifications only to the browsers supporting FCM example Chrome, Firefox etc.
