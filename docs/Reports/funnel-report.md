## Overview

Funnel reports can help you know what users have followed a defined set of events in a defined way. Users some times perform a set of events in a particular order this information may be helpful for you to determine in which phase of AIDA ( A–Awareness I – Interest D – Desire A – Action) the user is.

For example consider a user buying flow where the user has to first login into the application(awareness), search for the product(interest), reads about the product and payment options(desire), makes the payment and clicks the buy button(action). By creating a funnel you could segregate the users and look for the one which has followed a particular flow. 

In the above example if you want to know how many users are interested in buying the product you could make a funnel defining the steps as 
Step1: Log in
Step2: Search for the product

This will give the list of all users following the above-mentioned steps.

## Creating a Funnel

Creating a funnel is merely a few click process. Selecting the events in the defined order creates the required flow which then segments your users and helps you understand their behaviour.

### Step 1
Define the user i.e for what user segment are you trying to create the funnel. You can also create the funnel for all your users. Define the first flow event i.e the first event the user has triggered in your flow for which you are creating the funnel. You also need to tell us the time frame of the event(ex 100 days, 120 days).

### Step 3

Checking the default order or strict order option.

**Default Order:** When enabled, if your defined path is E1->E2->E3->E4 then path followed in this order E1->E3->E2->E3->E4 is also valid.

**Strict Order:** When enabled, if your defined path is E1->E2->E3->E4 then only path followed in this order (E1->E2->E3->E4) is valid
